# **Data Types and Variables**

Statically typed language where each variable and expression type is already known at 
compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold 
values of other data types.

Example: C, C++, Java.

### Java has two categories of data:

1. Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float and double
2. Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.

### Primitive Data Type
Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities.
